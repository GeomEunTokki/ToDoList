# ToDoList

- Runs by .py files
- Can run the python files and database file by downloading flask on venv (virtual environment)

Comments and Notes on the To-do List
1. Website design is very simple and easy to use
2. Simple features include entering in target user and task and deleting said task by entering 
    task ID on next page link on upper right corner; will then delete the said task from the list
    entirely
3. When adding target user and task, both string characters and integers are accepted.
   If 'Add Task' is clicked without anything in the input boxes, then an empty task and user is created.


Improvement changes if we were to use this in the future?
1. If we really wanted to impress future clients, then we can also add in some aesthetics features
  such as, with CSS, we can add transition from one color to another color by hovering the cursor
  over the element/ button.
  Other things can be added, such as timestamps to when the task was added, or how long ago the task
  was added. mm/dd/yyyy can also be another option, along with 00:00:0000 AM/PM for time.
  Background image can also be other feature to consider to attract attention to customers.

2. When adding target user and task, maybe we can add an alert for the user to make sure there is 
  a valid user name and task name, instead of creating empty names. (This would make sure there are
  no confusion in later times)
